This thesis aims to describe the current work I am undertaking in my DPhil and possible future directions that I may take on broadly related topics. Optimal experiment design only entered into my research in June 2018. The initial work in my DPhil related to a question posed to me by Yee Whye Teh, namely, `is probabilistic programming useful for Bayesian nonparametrics?'. Our NIPS workshop paper \cite{bnpppl} and our open source contributions to the language Turing were related to this question. Subsequently, I worked on a project with Benjamin Bloem-Reddy about Bayesian nonparametric models of networks which resulted in a UAI paper and oral presentation \cite{bntl}. During my internship at Uber and the past two months, I have worked on optimal experiment design. Chapter~\ref{chap:voed} will turn into a paper that we will submit to ICML 2019. We submitted a short version to the NIPS BDL workshop. Following ICML, I plan to continue research on optimal experiment design, as discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:future}.
