TODO change this!!!!!

This thesis aims to describe the work I have done so far in my DPhil and discuss the future directions I plan to take in my research. Of primary relevance to my current work and future plans is Chapter~\ref{chap:oed} on optimal experiment design. Chapter~\ref{chap:probabilistic_modelling} mostly concerns a project I worked on with Benjamin Bloem-Reddy which resulted in a UAI paper and oral presentation \cite{bntl}. Chapter~\ref{chap:ppl} relates to a question posed to me by Yee Whye Teh, namely, `is probabilistic programming useful for Bayesian nonparametrics?'. Our workshop paper \cite{bnpppl} and my open source contributions to the language \texttt{pyro} informed this chapter. Chapter~\ref{chap:oed}, the heart of this thesis, constitutes a draft of a paper that I plan to submit to ICML 2019, and represents the culmination of my internship with Uber. As detailed in Chapter~\ref{chap:future}, it is this project that I have found most exciting in my DPhil so far and that my future work will broadly be an extension of.
